# Coursera-Financial-Aid-Application
### Why are you applying for Financial Aid?
I'm a student form India and I'm interested in this course as it offers educational opportunities and is ideal for the career path I've chosen.
So, I'm writing to apply for the Financial Aid. Currently I've have no job or source of income of my own to pay for the expense of this course
for certification. I'm pursuing my bachelor degree through scholarships and bank loans. Along with me in our family I've two sisters who
are also studying so, it is very difficult for our father to pay for the expenses of us and I don't want to add one more headache to him by
applying this course so, I'm requesting coursera to consider my application and grant me financial aid to complete this course. I promise to
utilize this golden opportunity and work hard to learn more and more.
